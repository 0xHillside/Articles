## Processes
A process is a program in execution. It is an independent, self-contained unit of execution that runs in its own memory space. A process has its own resources, such as memory and system resources, and it runs independently of other processes. Processes are fundamental to modern operating systems and enable the execution of multiple tasks concurrently.

SO more specifically what are they doing in a windows process.... what may this curse entail now we shall discover... A process can be thought as a container that basically houses everything that a program needs to run the executable code, data, whatever same thing. A program can have MANY process that can run a perfect example would be google chrome, it creates a new process for every tab you open (lets ignore how it opens thousands and eats up all the ram without ever asking) 

Please bare in mind that SOME processes can also have their very own CHILD processes. a process is typically not aware of other processes outside of its own existence, so as far as it knows it thinks that its the only thing that runs on your machine and its them most important thing to EVER exist, each process has its own virtual address space which believes its EXCLUSIVELY AND ONLY allocated to it

so. what have we learnt? processes are extremely greedy and blind, *sigh*

## Threads
Each process is started by a single thread called the MAIN thread often its called the PRIMARY thread, but IT can also create additional threads from any of its OWN threads, so how does threads apply to processes?, different processes will have their own separate threads with their own tasks for example:
When there's multiple threads that's called "Multi-threading" (a shocker I know)

lets say I open a new tab in chrome and I decide to click next video and mute the video on YouTube, The YouTube will have a SEPERATE child process under the main process (chrome in this case) and the tasks of clicking the next video and muting the video will be executed by 2 separate threads.

## handles
handle is a generic unit of identification that we can use to identify something, its like a pointer to our object and it allows our program to or code to interact with it without directly accessing its memory location, the most common handles used in malware development specifically would be `hProcess`, `hThread` , `hModule`.

This allows for better access with the thread and processes!

## The differences
Think of it like this, threads are like feathers when it comes to memory and processes are like if a submarine where to fall at a children's hospital at Mach 10, If a process is a team then think of threads as the team members.

## how does this affect malware development?

This is very important for malware development because in malware development knowing these terms is very important because it leads us to be able to remotely implant processes and threads essentially hijacking another process to do whatever we may please, either it be playing a [funny song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&pp=ygUYbmV2ZXIgZ29ubmEgZ2l2ZSB5dW91IHVw) or stealing credentials, hijacking tokens and much. much. more.

This is the following tree of operation when creating malware!

- Manual loader / automatic loader
- generate shellcode
- manual obfuscation / automatic obfuscation 
	- Please note that sending your shellcode through 3 open source obfuscation tools will still get it detected rather than doing it manually
- Process injection
- PE to shellcode


In the next article ill cover more in-depth about the tree of operations in malware development and give examples on the tools that are used!, till then cheerio!
